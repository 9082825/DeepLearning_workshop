    "\n",
    "Once we compute the **loss** (difference between the predicted output and actual target), the next step is to **update the weights** so that the network improves its predictions. This is done using **gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 Gradient Descent: The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to **minimize the loss function** $ L $ by adjusting the weights $ w_j $. Gradient descent helps us do this by computing how much the loss changes with respect to each weight — this is the **partial derivative**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This derivative tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"If I increase weight $ w_j $ just a little, will the loss go up or down? And by how much?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 The Update Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the loss, we **move each weight** in the opposite direction of the gradient. That’s where the gradient descent update rule comes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_j = w_j - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ w_j $ is the weight for feature $ j $\n",
    "* $ \\eta $ is the **learning rate** — a small number like `0.1` that controls how big each update step is\n",
    "* $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j} $ is the gradient (i.e., how sensitive the loss is to changes in $ w_j $)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Why Subtract the Gradient?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **gradient** points in the direction that **increases** the loss.\n",
    "* We want to **minimize** the loss.\n",
    "* So, we go in the **opposite** direction — that’s why we subtract.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Learning Rate $ \\eta $: The Step Size\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $ \\eta $ is **too large**, we might overshoot the minimum — the network will not converge.\n",
    "* If $ \\eta $ is **too small**, learning will be very slow.\n",
    "* A value like $ \\eta = 0.1 $ is a reasonable starting point for simple problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of gradient descent as walking downhill:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The gradient tells you **which way is down**.\n",
    "* The learning rate tells you **how big a step to take**.\n",

    "### 🔁 PyTorch Makes It Easy\n",
    "\n",
    "When using PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We compute the loss.\n",
    "2. We call `loss.backward()` — this uses **autograd** to compute all the gradients.\n",
    "3. Then, PyTorch updates the weights automatically using:\n",

    "```python\n",
